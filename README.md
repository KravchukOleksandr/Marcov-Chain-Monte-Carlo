# Marcov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
*The project is created for educational purposes.*

## Preface

This project will explore the practical application of Markov chains – a branch of Mathematical Statistics. Each of the tasks will be solved by a modified Metropolis algorithm. To better understand the material I strongly recommend visiting the Wikipedia pages on Markov Chains, MCMC methods, and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

## Description of the project

There are two ipynb files: Ising_model (Modeling ferromagnetism in a crystal lattice) and distributions_model (modeling distributions that are difficult to simulate using classical statistical methods). The mathematical basis and algorithms are given in the files before the code.  

*Theoretical material was created with the usage of IPT NTUU KPI lectures.*
