# Marcov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
*The project is created for educational purposes.*

## Preface

This project will explore the practical application of Markov chains – a branch of Mathematical Statistics. Each of the tasks will be solved by a modified Metropolis algorithm. To better understand the material I strongly recommend visiting the Wikipedia pages on Markov Chains, MCMC methods, and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

## Description of the project

There are three ipynb files: Ising_model (Modeling ferromagnetism in a crystal lattice), distributions_model (modeling distributions that are difficult to simulate using classical statistical methods), text_decoder (application of Marcov Chains in text decoding). The mathematical basis and algorithms are given in the files before the code.  

The text file Soliaris.txt is cleared of unnecessary characters. This file is necessary to Run text_decoder.ipynb. However, you can download any book in txt format and clear it with the usage of commented code.

*Theoretical material was created with the usage of IPT NTUU KPI lectures.*
